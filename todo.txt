Future updates will include automation features such as:
- installing the RSpec gem
- creating a Gemfile
- specifying libraries such as require 'pry' and require 'rspec' within that Gemfile
- bundling the Gemfile
- initializing RSpec within that directory
- populating the .rspec folder with "--color" and "--require spec_helper
